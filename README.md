**ðŸš§ WORK IN PROGRESS ðŸš§**

This project is currently under active development. It is not yet functional, and there are no stable releases available.

A Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) solution for games that allows players to connect as if they were on the same local network.

## Features

- Create and join virtual game networks
- NAT traversal using STUN/TURN for P2P connections
- End-to-end encryption
- Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Local data storage using SQLite

## System Architecture

GoVPN is organized in a modular client-server architecture, with P2P communication between clients to minimize latency. The architecture is structured as follows:

### Shared Libraries

- **libs/crypto_utils**: Implements cryptographic functions to ensure communication security, including:
  - Ed25519 key generation
  - Message signing and verification
  - Encryption for transmitted data
  - Secure identifier generation

- **libs/models**: Defines data structures shared between client and server:
  - Network: Represents a virtual game network
  - Message: Defines the format of messages exchanged via WebSocket
  - NetworkPacket: Structure for network packets tunneled through the VPN
  - ClientInfo: Information about connected clients

- **libs/network**: Manages the virtual network interfaces and packet handling, including:
  - VirtualNetwork: Main class that coordinates peer communication
  - Virtual IP address mapping
  - Encapsulation and routing of packets between clients
- **libs/signaling**: Provides the client-side signaling logic and data models for WebSocket communication with the server, including:
  - client: Implements the WebSocket client for signaling
  - models: Defines signaling-specific message structures

### System Components

- **cmd/server**: The central signaling server responsible for orchestrating network operations and facilitating P2P connections. Its key functions include:
  - **Network Creation and Management**: Handles the creation, joining, and management of virtual VPN networks.
  - **Client Authentication**: Authenticates clients using Ed25519 keys to ensure secure access.
  - **Connection Establishment**: Relays signaling messages (e.g., WebRTC SDP offers/answers, ICE candidates) between clients to help them establish direct P2P connections.
  - **Data Persistence**: Utilizes Supabase for persistent storage of network and client metadata.
  - **WebSocketServer**: Manages all incoming and outgoing WebSocket connections with clients.
  - **SupabaseManager**: Provides an interface for interacting with the Supabase database.

- **cmd/client**: The client application with a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to:
  - Create and join virtual game networks.
  - Manage P2P connections to other clients within a network.
  - Store local configurations and data using SQLite.
  - Provides a user-friendly interface built with Fyne (v2.0+).
  - Composed of modular components like `NetworkManager`, `SignalingClient`, etc., for clear separation of concerns.

### Communication Flow

The communication in GoVPN follows a hybrid model, leveraging a central server for signaling and P2P connections for actual data transfer.

    Note over ClientA,ClientB: P2P Connection Established

    ClientB->>ClientA: Direct Encrypted Communication (VPN Tunnel)
    Note over ClientA,ClientB: All subsequent VPN traffic flows directly between clients.
```

1. **Signaling Phase**:
   - The server acts as a crucial intermediary for initial connection establishment and coordination.
   - Clients connect to the server via WebSockets, authenticate using Ed25519 keys, and exchange metadata about available networks and peers.
   - The server maintains an in-memory representation of active networks and connected peers, ensuring real-time updates.
   
2. **P2P Connection Establishment**:
   - Once clients are authenticated and aware of each other, they use the server to exchange WebRTC signaling messages (SDP offers/answers and ICE candidates).
   - STUN (Session Traversal Utilities for NAT) servers are used by clients to discover their public IP addresses, aiding in NAT traversal.
   - TURN (Traversal Using Relays around NAT) servers provide a fallback relay mechanism if a direct P2P connection cannot be established.
   - The server's role in this phase is purely to relay these signaling messages; it does not process or store the actual WebRTC data.

3. **Direct Communication (VPN Tunnel)**:
   - After the WebRTC handshake is complete, a direct P2P connection (VPN tunnel) is established between the clients.
   - All subsequent VPN traffic (network packets) flows directly between the connected clients, bypassing the signaling server.
   - Data is end-to-end encrypted using a key derived from the network password, ensuring privacy and security.

4. **Virtual Network**:
   - Each client within a network is assigned a unique virtual IP address (e.g., in the 10.10.0.x range).
   - Network packets are encapsulated, encrypted, and routed through these direct P2P data channels, creating a virtual local area network.

- **Home Tab**: Displays saved networks and connection options
- **Settings Tab**: Application settings
- **Network List**: List of saved networks with connection options
- **Dialogs**: For creating/joining networks and managing connections

### Local Storage

The client stores data locally using SQLite, including:

- Computer settings
- Saved networks and passwords
- Connection history
- Cryptographic keys

## Release Process

This project uses GitHub Actions to automatically build and release the server and client components.

### Creating a Server Release

To create a new server release:

```bash
# Tag the commit with a server version
git tag server-v1.0.0
git push origin server-v1.0.0
```

This will trigger the server release workflow that builds binaries for:
- Linux (amd64)
- Windows (amd64)
- macOS (Intel/amd64)
- macOS (Apple Silicon/arm64)

### Creating a Client Release

To create a new client release:

```bash
# Tag the commit with a client version
git tag client-v1.0.0
git push origin client-v1.0.0
```

This will trigger the client release workflow that builds:
- Standalone binaries for Linux, Windows, and macOS
- Packaged applications when possible

## Manual Compilation
